-# maintenance overhead is an unnecessary burden. If this performance issue is solved
-# by PyQt5, the QRectF coordinate approach can be removed by simply deleting all of the
-# "if _USE_QRECT" code blocks in ScatterPlotItem. Ideally, drawPixmap would accept the
-# numpy arrays of coordinates directly, which would improve performance significantly,
